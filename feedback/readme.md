# Omnico Project 1 Evaluation for Sarah Iqbal

### Project Implementation and Output

- Your Python script (`main.py`) correctly reads and processes the CSV data. It calculates the total sessions, average happiness ratings, and average session durations for each algorithm.
- The logic that computes the highest average happiness rating and the longest average session duration using the `max` function with appropriate lambda functions is correctly implemented.
- The final printed output exactly matches the format and results specified in the project requirements.

### Report Document

- Your `report.md` file includes the required sections such as Introduction, Methodology, Results, Observations and Insights, and Conclusions and Recommendations.
- The statistical findings in your report (e.g., JoyStream with the highest happiness rating and DeepPulse with the longest session duration) are clearly presented and align with your program's output.
- There are a couple of minor typos (e.g., "uder" instead of "user" and "identiy" instead of "identify"). While these do not affect the correctness of your analysis, they are worth watching for in future reports to ensure maximum professionalism.

### Code Structure and Version Control

- The structure of your code is clear and demonstrates a logical flow from reading the file to processing data and finally displaying the computed results.
- Your commit log shows clear progression and that you addressed and completed all the requirements of the project.
